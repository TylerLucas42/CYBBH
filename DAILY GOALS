I WILL BE EXPECTED TO USE THE NEW TUNNELING METHOD AT 1ST RADBAT:

OPS: ssh -MS /tmp/jump student@10.50.22.72 #Create a master socket on the jump box
JUMP: for i in {97..126}; do (ping -c 1 192.168.28.$i | grep "bytes from" &) ; done #ping sweep
OPS: ssh -S /tmp/jump -O forward -D 9050 (IP) #on opstation, -S says to use a socket file (the socket file we made at the start of the script to SSH to the jumpbox & set up -D dynamic port fwd.
OPS: proxychains nmap 192.168.28.100,111 [80,21] #nmap the discovered IPs
OPS: proxychains nc 192.168.28.[100/111] [80/2222] #get accurate ports for discovered IPs
OPS: ssh -S /tmp/jump jump -O forward -L1111:192.168.28.100:80 -L2222:192.168.28.100:2222 -L3333:192.168.28.111:80 -L5555:192.168.28.111:2222
OPS: ss -ntlp

OPS: ssh -S /tmp/jump jump -O forward -L1111:192.168.28.100:80 -L2222:192.168.28.100:2222 -L3333:192.168.28.111:80 -L5555:192.168.28.111:2222
This creates a tunnel with a single pid across all processes - just a singular TCP connection. TCP connections are a finite resource, so this is valuable! Also, everything happens by one connection only. No confusion.
#Then type firefox through X11, type in http://127.0.0.1:1111 / http://127.0.0.1:3333
OPS: ssh -MS /tmp/t1 creds@127.0.0.1 -p 2222 #ssh again, creating a new master socket this time with acquired credentials to the the desired 192.168.28.100 box with an alt SSH port on 2222


Nmap scripts: located in /usr/share/nmap/scripts/
good nmap script for http enumeration: nmap --script=http-enum.nse [IP]
