- https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc-index.html (great resource for best practices)
- Ethernet: IEEE 802.3, Wireless: IEEE 802.11, Token Ring: IEEE 802.5
- Data Link: Level 2 OSI
        - Upper Level 2: LLC (Logical Link Control)
        - Lower Level 2: MAC (Media Access Control)
- Switch operation modes:
        - Cut-through: Tells switch to fast-forward: just look at destination, ignore all other bits and simply forward to dest user. (fastest)
        - Fragment-free: Looks at first 64 bytes of eth frame to decide what to do with the frame
        - Store-and-forward: Checks packet thoroughly, verify and forward it out once the entire frame is received and good to go (slowest)
- CAM Table Overflow/MAC Attack: DOS. Fill CAM tale with spoofed MAC entries, traffic from all further MACs once the CAM table is full will be flooded out on all ports and cause chaos
        - This works because modern software can spoof MACs, as opposed to in the past when MACs were burned-in only
- MAC Formatting (48 bytes)
        - XXXXXX: OUI - Assigned by IANA (24 bytes)
        - YYYYYY: NIC - Assigned by vendor (unique to each device - 24 bytes)
        - Windows: XX-XX-XX-YY-YY-YY
        - UNIX: XX:XX:XX:YY:YY:YY
        - Cisco: XXXX.XXYY.YYYY
        - Unicast: One to one (8th bit is on)
        - Multicast: One to many (8th bit is on)
        - Broadcast: One to all (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF - all bits on)
- MAC Header Ethertypes: 0x0800 (IPv4), 0x86DD (IPv6), 0x0806 (ARP), 0x08100 (VLAN Tag)
