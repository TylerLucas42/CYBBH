Forms of Persistence

Make sure to understand user things with regard to windows boot process (etc profile)

file /run/systemd/system (if not exists, it's sysv)

ALL:
- Strange ports: sequential, all the same, etc. (3389 is just RDP)
- Obfuscation:
  - Taking name of something legit ex.GoogleUpdate
  - Abnormal for govt. device, such as Steam
  - Misspellings of words
  - Running from the wrong location such as Downloads

Linux:
- Cron
  - cat /etc/crontab
  - ls /var/spool/cron
  - /etc/cron.d
- cat .bash_logout (has scripts that execute on logout)
- /etc/rc[0-6].d (actual settings for runlevels)
- /etc/profile
- /etc/environment?
- services/processes
  - ps -elf
  - top / htop
  - systemctl status/start/stop
2 Linux variations:
- sysv
  - /etc/init.d (SysV)
  - /etc/inittab (specifies runlevels for Sysv)
- systemd
  - /lib/systemd/systemd (systemd)
  - /usr/lib/systemd/system (systemd)

Windows
- Autoruns is SUPER HANDY ( net use http:/live.sysinternals.com - map to Z drive)
- schtasks
- registry locations
  - HKLM:\(run)
- powershell profiles (4 of them - allusersallhosts, alluserscurrenthost, currentuserallhosts, currentusercurrenthost in that order)
  - to see if any profiles have been created, test-path -path $profile.[currentUsercurrentHost], and if there is actually a path for any of them, check it
- services/processes
  - get-process
  - get-service
  - get-ciminstance win32_service
- artefacts (KNOW HOW TO LOOK AT THESE - windows auditing & logging)
  - BAM
  - Prefetch
  - Userassist
  - info left in a registry key
