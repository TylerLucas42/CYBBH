Look at WGU: proficiency-based (no homework really, if you can pass the final then you pass but it's on you to get there. highly based)
- per semester
- you can probably take 6 or 7 courses per year just on TA alone (cheap)
- Really the only good major here is going to be Master's in Secondary Science Education (designed to build off of a non-teaching BS degree, ie. physics)

LIBERTY UNIVERSITY: free with TA (specifically designed to charge servicemembers exactly $250 per credit hour, which is the max USMC will give per credit hour.
Just have to worry about annual limit! $4500 per fiscal year, 120 credit hours required for degree = 18 free credit hours per year, 7 years to graduation (take 9 credit hours per semester)
PHET simulations are cool
